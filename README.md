# Hello World Node.js Program

This is my very first program written using Node.js! It's a simple application that prints two messages to the console.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you run the program on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** You need to have Node.js and its package manager (npm is included with Node.js, or you can use yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from the official Node.js website: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

### Running the Program

1.  **Save the code:** Create a new file named `app.js` (or any other name you prefer with a `.js` extension) and paste the following code into it:

    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello World from the node js");

    console.log("Hey there ! i am javascript");
    ```

2.  **Open your terminal or command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where you saved the `app.js` file.

3.  **Run the program:** Execute the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

    or if you are using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn start app.js
    ```

### Expected Output

After running the command, you should see the following output in your terminal:
